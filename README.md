# UVToolsScripts
A colleciont of scripts I have used in UVTools to prepare my files for resin printing.  

* ScriptElephantsFootDimming - 
Reduces elephant's foot by dimming model walls in layers which have a longer exposure than normal.  Changes are normally applied to bottom and transition layers.

* ScriptExposureFinderByGrid - 
Dims regions of a build plate to allow multiple calibration objects to be printed concurrently at different effective exposure times.

Please look at the Wiki page for additional information.
